It pays 9 months of my salary, it subsidizes my doctoral students' time through teaching assistantships, it provides space and staff support, and it provides my core intellectual community. The iSchool's resources come from tuition, fees, taxes from the Washington state government, and philanthropic giving."

							. The majority of my sponsored research is funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, which is tax-funded. I write proposals, which are confidentially evaluated by my peers, and when my peers and NSF find my proposals to have compelling intellectual merit and potential for broader impact, I receive grants. I use these grants to support my summer salary, my doctoral students stipends, benefits, and tuition, my lab's research expenses, hourly undergraduate research assistants, and our travel. My doctoral students also write their own proposals, often winning NSF graduate research fellowships to support the first 3 years of their doctoral work. My NSF awards include:
							<ul>
							{
								this.props.app.getProfile().getFunding(
									funding => funding.funder === "National Science Foundation" && !funding.private, 
									funding => -funding.commitment.end.getFullYear()
								).map((award, index) => <li key={index}><a href={award.url} target="_blank">{award.title}</a></li>)
							}
							</ul>
							Six of my 13 past and present doctoral students have also won NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, which support three years of their research.

These are no strings attached contributions, which I rely on for expenses that the iSchool and NSF will not support, such as buying out of teaching to free up research time and unplanned research expenses."

I have significant concerns with the treatment of Google researchers of color, however, and so I don't expect to be pursuing further Google funding until they apologize and reimagine their corporate culture."
