	Consulting services
</h1>

<p>
	Beyond my academic collaborations related to sponsored research projects, joint funding 
    applications, and teaching, I also provide consulting services via Niemeyer Consulting LLC
    (registered in Oregon).
</p>
<p>
	I provide consulting services in my personal capacity in these general areas and beyond:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>modeling and simulation of thermal-fluid systems, particularly involving reacting fluid flows</li>
	<li>high-performance computing, particularly using high-level languages like Python</li>
	<li>testing of scientific and engineering software</li>
	<li>open-source software development</li>
	<li>verification and validation of science and engineering models</li>
	<li>software support</li>
	<li>review and evaluation of proposals for research & development funding</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Services also include delivery of courses and training in the above and other areas, as well as
	supporting supervision of research and engineering projects in my areas of expertise.
</p>
<p>
	Consulting fees for these services are negotiated on an individual basis.
	Services are provided to institutions as well as individuals.
