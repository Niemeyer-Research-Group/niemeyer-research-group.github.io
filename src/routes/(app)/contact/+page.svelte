	<span>
		&mdash; If you're a current OSU student,
		contact me via one of the channels below to see if a meeting makes sense. 
		If you're in one my classes, see the syllabus for my course office hours.
		If you're not a OSU student, write me an email; we'll meet if appropriate.

	{/snippet}
	&mdash; I primarily use email to communicate with people I don't know and occasionally with collaborators. 
	If you're a student, a potential collaborator, or anyone else, write me an email to connect. 
	I typically check my email throughout the day during the work week, but may not respond until I have the bandwidth.

<Block link="https://slack.com/" header="Slack">
	{#snippet image()}
		<Image
			url={"/images/contact/slack.jpg"}
			alt="The Slack logo."
		/>
	{/snippet}
	&mdash; Slack is my preferred medium for collaboration with my students and other collaborators. 
	During the work day I treat Slack like instant messaging, and after hours I treat it like email.
	Unfortunately, Oregon State stopped supporting Slack for everyone, but I maintain a workspace 
	for my research group.

	{/snippet}
	&mdash; I occasionally post on Bluesky, but actively review my timeline, and
	I do respond to DMs and/or replies.

	{/snippet}
	&mdash; I host a lot of my content and software projects on GitHub.

	{#snippet image()}
		<Image
			url={"/images/contact/linkedin.jpg"}
			alt="The LinkedIn logo."
		/>
	{/snippet}
	&mdash; I use LinkedIn to manage professional contacts, but not for much else.
	I usually only accept connections from people I've met in real life and have 
	some professional relationship with (students, collaborators, professional colleagues).

	{/snippet}
	&mdash; Please don't call me on the phone. 
	It's never the right time, and I'm rarely in my office when you want to reach me. 
	Write me on one of the platforms above first and we can schedule a call if necessary.
