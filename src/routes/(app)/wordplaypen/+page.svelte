<h1>
    Are you a University of Washington undergraduate interested in gaining web
    development experience and making programming more playful, global, and
    accessible?
</h1>

<Alert
    >Already registered for INFO 499 with me already? We'll be meeting in <strong
        >BLD 070 on Tuesdays from 5:30-6:30 pm</strong
    >, starting Wednesday, September 26th, 2023. It's a basement, but it's cozy,
    and has flexible tables, so it will do.</Alert
>

<p
    >I'm recruiting students to join our <strong>Wordplaypen</strong>, a team
    that helps design, build, and maintain <External to="https://wordplay.dev"
        >Wordplay</External
    >. Wordplay is a playful programming platform for creating accessible,
    interactive typography that celebrates the world's languages. Our vision is
    <em
        >to create a global platform for creative expression with language that
        celebrates every indivdual's culture, identity, and values, while also
        enabling youth to learn about the power and limits of computing</em
    >.
</p>

<p>
    I'm excited to work with any University of Washington undergraduate excited
    about that vision and who has:
</p>

<ul
    ><li>A passion for equity and justice.</li>
    <li
        >(Optionally) lived experience with disability and/or fluency in
        non-English languages. This is because a major goal of Wordplay is
        accessibility and global inclusion, and we can't meaningfully achieve
        that without your knowledge and lived experience.</li
    ><li
        >Basic web development knowledge (e.g. from CSE 154, INFO 340, or other
        experience). And I do mean basic &mdash; it's okay if you're still just
        learning. This is an opportunity to strengthen your skills.</li
    >
</ul>

<p
    >You don't need to know how programming languages are built, but you'll
    probably learn about it by contributing.</p
>

<p>Here are some things you might contribute:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Designing and redesigning the language and platform</li>
    <li>Implementing new user interface features </li>
    <li>Improving correctness and reliability of current features</li>
    <li>Localizing to one or more of the world's languages</li>
    <li>Writing automated tests</li>
    <li>Verifying accessibility</li>
    <li>Providing peer feedback</li>
    <li
        >Teaching peers, including programming, testing, software engineering,
        and design skills</li
    >
</ul>

<Linkable id="whycontribute">Why should I contribute?</Linkable>

<p>Many reasons!</p>

<ul>
    <li
        >Learn <External to="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"
            >TypeScript</External
        >, <External to="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Sveltekit</External>, and/or <External
            to="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</External
        >, and strengthen your knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li
    >
    <li
        >Gain practical skills in software engineering, including bug triage,
        Git workflows, code reviews, verification, and programming languages.
        (INFO 442 is a great place to do that too, but this will be 100%
        hands-on.)
    </li>
    <li
        >Contribute to a programming platform that centers equity and inclusion,
        and research on how to achieve that.</li
    >
    <li
        >Be credited on the Wordplay website and repository as a contributor,
        which can be helpful for resume building.</li
    >
    <li
        >Get a letter of recommendation from me about your contributions to the
        team.
    </li></ul
>

<Linkable id="howcontribute">How do I join the team?</Linkable>

<p
    >First, ensure you are available at the day, time, and location listed at
    the top of this page. We'll run hybrid sprint planning meetings each week at
    that time, and attendance is mandatory unless ill. (In-person is preferred,
    but virtual will always be possible for reasons of illness, travel,
    commuting, etc.)</p
>

<p
    >Then, <External
        to="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics/curriculum/experiential-learning/independent-study"
        >register for INFO 499</External
    > for anywhere from <strong>1-5 credits</strong> by the start of the quarter.
    As part of your proposal, indicate:
</p>

<ul
    ><li>Why you want to participate,</li>
    <li>What skills and lived experience you would bring to the project, and</li
    ><li>How much time you are willing to commit.</li>
</ul>

<p
    >The INFO 499 proposal form (which I don't control) don't quite align with
    the questions above. Just put answers wherever they fit best. I'm the only
    one who reviews these, so you're not going to be rejected for filling it
    "wrong" because there is no wrong.</p
>

<p
    >iSchool student services can be slow to process these, but I expect to
    approve all proposals. Don't worry about trying to convince me, or writing
    some big epic essay, or being rejected. This isn't a competitive admissions
    process, I just want some context for your goals and availability, so I can
    prepare a good experience.</p
>

<p>
    Your proposal can be very short; just a few sentences in each section would
    suffice.</p
>

<p>Participation is quarterly and at a minimum will involve: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Onboarding</strong>, if you haven't yet done it.</li>
    <li
        ><strong>A weekly sprint planning meeting</strong> with Amy to build
        community, identify and assign issues, and offer guidance. The first
        meeting we will identify issues in
        <External to="https://github.com/amyjko/wordplay/issues"
            >Wordplay's GitHub repository</External
        > that are suitable for your time commitment and skills.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>Asynchronous collaboration</strong> on Slack and GitHub on issues.</li
    >
    <li
        >An end of quarter <strong>celebration</strong> of everyone's contributions!</li
    >
</ul>

<p
    >More credits just means more commitments, so sign up for how much time you
    want to commit. Your INFO 499 grade can be graded or credit/no credit; your
    final assessment will be based on meeting the milestones you set in the
    first week of the quarter, but mostly as a disincentive to overcommit.</p
