<h1>
    Are you a University of Washington undergraduate interested in gaining web
    development experience and making programming more playful, global, and
    accessible?
</h1>

<p
    >I'm recruiting students to join our <strong>Wordplaypen</strong>, a team
    that helps design, build, and maintain <External to="https://wordplay.dev"
        >Wordplay</External
    >. Wordplay is a playful programming platform for creating accessible,
    interactive typography that celebrates the world's languages. Our vision is
    <em
        >to create a global platform for creative expression with language that
        celebrates every indivdual's culture, identity, and values, while also
        enabling youth to learn about the power and limits of computing</em
    >.
</p>

<p>
    I'm excited to work with any University of Washington undergraduate excited
    about that vision and who has:
</p>

<ul
    ><li>A passion for equity and justice.</li>
    <li
        >And (optionally) lived experience with disability and/or fluency in
        non-English languages. This is because a major goal of Wordplay is
        accessibility and global inclusion, and we can't meaningfully achieve
        that without your knowledge and lived experience.</li
    ><li
        >Basic web development knowledge (e.g. from CSE 154, INFO 340, or other
        experience). And I do mean basic &mdash; it's okay if you're still just
        learning the basics.</li
    >
</ul>

<p
    >You don't need to know how programming languages are built, but you'll
    probably learn about it by contributing.</p
>

<p>Here are some things you might contribute:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Designing and redesigning the language and platform</li>
    <li>Implementing new user interface features </li>
    <li>Improving correctness and reliability of current features</li>
    <li>Localizing to one or more of the world's languages</li>
    <li>Writing automated tests</li>
    <li>Verifying accessibility</li>
    <li>Providing peer feedback</li>
    <li
        >Teaching peers, including programming, testing, software engineering,
        and design skills</li
    >
</ul>

<Linkable id="whycontribute">Why should I contribute?</Linkable>

<p>Many reasons!</p>

<ul>
    <li
        >Learn <External to="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"
            >TypeScript</External
        >, <External to="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Sveltekit</External>, and/or <External
            to="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</External
        >, and strengthen your knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li
    >
    <li
        >Gain practical skills in software engineering, including bug triage,
        Git workflows, code reviews, verification, and programming languages.
        (INFO 442 is a great place to do that too, but this will be 100%
        hands-on.)
    </li>
    <li
        >Contribute to a programming platform that centers equity and inclusion,
        and research on how to achieve that.</li
    >
    <li
        >Be credited on the Wordplay website and repository as a contributor,
        which can be helpful for resume building.</li
    >
    <li
        >Get a letter of recommendation from me about your contributions to the
        team.
    </li></ul

<Linkable id="howcontribute">How do I join the team?</Linkable>

<p
    >First, ensure you are available <strong>Tuesdays from 5:30-6:30 pm</strong
    >, held on campus in my office, Mary Gates 015E. We'll run hybrid sprint
    planning meetings each week at that time, and attendance is mandatory unless
    ill. (In-person is preferred, but virtual will always be possible for
    reasons of illness, travel, commuting, etc.)</p
>

<p
    >Then, register for <External
        to="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics/curriculum/experiential-learning/independent-study"
        >INFO 499</External
    > for anywhere from <strong>1-5 credits</strong> by the start of the quarter.
    As part of your proposal, indicate:
</p><p /><ul
    ><li>Why you want to participate,</li>
    <li>What skills and lived experience you would bring to the project, and</li
    ><li>How much time you are willing to commit.</li>
</ul>

<p> Your proposal can be very short; three sentences would suffice.</p>

<p>Participation is quarterly and at a minimum will involve: </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Onboarding</strong>, if you haven't yet done it.</li>
    <li
        ><strong>A weekly sprint planning meeting</strong> with Amy to build
        community, identify and assign issues, and offer guidance. The first
        meeting we will identify issues in
        <External to="https://github.com/amyjko/wordplay/issues"
            >Wordplay's GitHub repository</External
        > that are suitable for your time commitment and skills.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>Asynchronous collaboration</strong> on Slack and GitHub on issues.</li
    >
    <li
        >An end of quarter <strong>celebration</strong> of everyone's contributions!</li
    >
</ul>

<p
    >More credits just means more commitments, so sign up for how much time you
    want to commit. Your INFO 499 grade can be graded or credit/no credit; your
    final assessment will be based on meeting the milestones you set in the
    first week of the quarter, but mostly as a disincentive to overcommit.</p
