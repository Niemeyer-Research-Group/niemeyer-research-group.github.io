This is my research group website, where I host everything about my role as a professor, and more. It's hosted on GitHub Pages at https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io.

This site is heavily based on [Amy Ko's faculty webpage](https://github.com/amyjko/faculty).

If you found an issue or a bug, please submit an issue!

Are you interested in adapting this for your own site? Go for it! The `CC0` license implies a few things:

-   I view the code as public domain. Do what you like with it.
-   The site isn't written for reuse, so I recommend forking.
-   I'm not in a position to provide a ton of support for adapting it, but I'm happy to answer the occasional question.

## Building the Site

To build and preview the site:
1. ` npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run preview`
